## Challenging Interpersonal Situation

During my work on the **Waterloo Hydrogeologic** website, I was tasked with designing the UI/UX for the project. One of the challenges I faced was a difference in perspective with a co-worker regarding the layout and design philosophy. While I emphasized a user-centered approach to enhance accessibility and engagement, my colleague was focused on maintaining traditional design elements that the team had used in previous projects.

To resolve this, I initiated a collaborative discussion where I presented user research data and mockups that illustrated the benefits of modern, responsive design. I also encouraged my colleague to share their concerns and ideas, which helped us find a middle ground. By aligning on key objectives and incorporating feedback from both sides, we delivered a design that balanced innovation with familiarity, ultimately receiving positive feedback from stakeholders.

This experience reinforced the importance of active listening, data-driven arguments, and teamwork in overcoming interpersonal challenges.
